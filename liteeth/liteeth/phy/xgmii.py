        # ---------- Deficit idle count mechanism state ----------

        # Because XGMII only allows start of frame characters to be placed on
        # lane 0 (first and fifth octet in a 64-bit bus word), when a packet's
        # length % 4 != 0, we can't transmit exactly 12 XGMII idle characters
        # inter-frame gap (the XGMII end of frame character counts towards the
        # inter-frame gap, while start of frame does not). Given we are required
        # to transmit a minimum of 12 bytes IFG, it's allowed to send packet
        # length % 4 bytes additional IFG bytes. However this would waste
        # precious bandwidth transmitting these characters.
        #
        # Thus, 10Gbit/s Ethernet and above allow using the deficit idle count
        # mechanism. It allows to delete some idle characters, as long as an
        # average count of >= 12 bytes IFG is maintained. This is to be
        # implemented as a two bit counter as specified in IEEE802.3-2018,
        # section four, 46.3.1.4 Start control character alignment.
