# Picolibc
Copyright Â© 2018-2022 Keith Packard

Picolibc is library offering standard C library APIs that targets
small embedded systems with limited RAM. Picolibc was formed by blending
code from [Newlib](http://sourceware.org/newlib/) and
[AVR Libc](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/).

Build status:

 * ![Linux](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/workflows/Linux/badge.svg?branch=main)
 * ![Mac OS X](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/workflows/Mac%20OS%20X/badge.svg)

## License

Picolibc source comes from a variety of places and has a huge variety
of copyright holders and license texts. While much of the code comes
from Newlib, none of the GPL-related bits used to build the library
are left in the repository, so all of the source code uses BSD-like
licenses, a mixture of 2- and 3- clause BSD itself and a variety of
other (mostly older) licenses with similar terms.

There are two files used for testing printf, test/printf-tests.c and
test/testcases.c which are licensed under the GPL version 2 or
later. There is also a shell script, GeneratePicolibcCrossFile.sh
which is licensed under the AGPL version 3 or later which is provided
as a helper for people building the library, but not used by picolibc
otherwise.

The file COPYING.picolibc contains all of the current copyright and
license information in the Debian standard machine-readable format. It
was generated using the make-copyrights and find-copyright
scripts.

## Supported Architectures

Picolibc inherited code for a *lot* of architectures from Newlib, but
at this point only has code to build for the following targets:

 * ARM (32- and 64- bit)
 * i386 (Native and Linux hosted, for testing)
 * RISC-V (both 32- and 64- bit)
 * x86_64 (Native and Linux hosted, for testing)
 * PowerPC (big and little endian)
 * m68k
 * ESP8266 (xtensa-lx106-elf)
 * Motorola 68000 (m68k)

Supporting architectures that already have Newlib code requires:

 1. newlib/libc/machine/_architecture_/meson.build to build the
    architecture-specific libc bits. This should at least include
    setjmp/longjmp support as these cannot be performed in
    architecture independent code.

 2. newlib/libm/machine/_architecture_/meson.build to build any
    architecture-specific libm bits

 3. picocrt/machine/_architecture_ source code and build bits if you
    need custom startup code for the architecture. Useful in all
    cases, but this is necessary to run tests under qemu if your
    platform can do that.

 4. cross-_gcc-triple_.txt to configure the meson cross-compilation
    mechanism to use the right tools

 5. do-_architecture_-configure to make testing the cross-compilation
    setup easier.

 6. newlib/libc/picolib support. This should include whatever startup
    helpers are required (like ARM interrupt vector) and TLS support
    (if your compiler includes this).

 7. run-_architecture_ script to run tests under QEMU. Look at the ARM
    and RISC-V examples to get a sense of what this needs to do and
    how it gets invoked from the cross-_gcc-triple_.txt configuration
    file.

## Relation to newlib

Picolibc is mostly built from pieces of newlib, and retains the
directory structure of that project. While there have been a lot of
changes in the build system and per-thread data storage, the bulk of
the source code remains unchanged.

To keep picolibc and newlib code in sync, newlib changes will be
regularly incorporated. To ease integration of these changes into
picolibc, some care needs to be taken while editing the code:

 * Files should not be renamed.
 * Fixes that also benefit users of newlib should also be sent to the
   newlib project
 * Changes, where possible, should be made in a way compatible with
   newlib design. For example, instead of using 'errno' (which is
   valid in picolibc), use __errno_r(r), even when 'r' is not defined
   in the local context.

The bulk of newlib changes over the last several years have been in
areas unrelated to the code used by picolibc, so keeping things in
sync has not been difficult so far.

## Releases

### Picolibc version 1.7.6

 1. Fix use with C++ applications caused by a syntax error in
    picolibc.specs

 2. Automatically include '-nostdlib' to options used while
    evaluating build rules to ensure tests work as expected.

 3. Publish aarch64 inline math functions, ensure that inline fma
    functions work in installed applications for arm and risc-v.

### Picolibc version 1.7.5

 1. Fix build on big-endian systems (thanks to Thomas Daede)

 2. Add m68k support (thanks to Thomas Daede).

 3. Fix build issues with ARM Cortex-a9 target (thanks to Ilia
    Sergachev).

 4. Fix fwrite(x,0,y,z) in both tinystdio and legacy stdio. tinystdio
    returned the wrong value and legacy stdio caused a divide-by-zero
    fault.

 5. Update Ryu code to match upstream (minor fixes)

 6. Fix various __NEWLIB and __PICOLIBC macros; they were using a
    single leading underscore instead of two (thanks to Vincent
    Palatin).

 7. Fix tinystdio error-handling bugs

 8. Merge recent newlib changes (fixed ltdoa in legacy stdio)

 9. Speed improvements for github CI system

 10. Big-endian PowerPC support

 11. Fail builds if most 'run_command' uses fail (thanks to Johan de
     Claville Christiansen)

 12. Positional parameters in tinystdio. With this, I think tinystdio
     is feature complete.

 13. Support for multiple build-styles of picolibc (minsize/release)
     in one binary package. This still requires separate meson runs.

 14. Testing with glibc test code. This uncovered numerous bugs,
     mostly math errno/exception mistakes, but also a few serious
     bugs, including a couple of places where the nano-malloc failed
     to check for out-of-memory. Picolibc now passes all of the glibc
     math tests except for jn, yn, lgamma and tgamma. The picolibc
     versions of those functions are too inaccurate. Picolibc also
     passes most other relevant glibc tests, including stdio,
     string and stdlib areas.

 15. Tinystdio version of fcvt now has a static buffer large enough to
     hold the maximum return size.

 16. Tinystdio versions of ecvtbuf and fcvtbuf have been replaced
     with ecvt_r and fcvt_r equivalents, which take a 'len' parameter
     to prevent buffer overruns.

 17. Add the GeneratePicolibcCrossFile.sh script which provides a way
     to isolate picolibc build scripts from the vagaries of meson
     version shifts (thanks to R. Diez).

 18. Add 'semihost' version of crt0 that calls 'exit' after main
     returns. The ARM and RISC-V versions of this also include trap
     handlers for exceptions that print out information and exit when
     an exception occurs.

### Picolibc version 1.7.4

 1. Clean up meson build bits, including use of 'fs module (thanks to
    Yasushi Shoji).

 2. Speed up github actions by sharing Debian docker image (thanks to
    Yasushi Shoji).

 3. Reduce use of intermediate static libraries during build

 4. Use standard Meson architecture names everywhere (thanks to
    Yasushi Shoji).

 5. Support building with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE enabled.

 6. Clean up 32-bit arm assembly code, eliminating __aeabi wrappers
    where possible.

 7. Add basename, dirname and fnmatch back.

 8. Fix all old-style (K&R) function definitions.

 9. Enable lots more compiler warning flags.

 10. Remove last uses of alloca in legacy stdio code.

 11. Add tests from musl libc-testsuite. There aren't many tests, but
     these identified a few bugs.

 12. Add lots more exception and errno tests for the math functions.

 13. Restructure math library to always use the __math_err functions
     to raise exceptions and set errno. This removes the w_*.c wrapper
     functions and eliminates the __ieee names. This centralizes
     compiler work-arounds to ensure run-time evaluation of
     expressions intended to raise exceptions. In the process, all of
     the libm/math files were reformatted with clang-format.

 14. Make tinystdio '%a' compatible with glibc, including supporting
     rounding and trimming trailing zeros when possible.

 15. Remove floating point exception generation code on targets
     without floating point exception support. This reduces code size
     on soft float machines without affecting results.

### Picolibc version 1.7.3

 1. Add -Wall -Wextra to default builds. Fixed warnings this raised.

 2. Add htonl and friends (based on __htonl). Thanks to Johan de
    Claville Christiansen

 3. Set errno in scalbn and scalbnf (patch forwarded to newlib).

 4. Merge newlib recent changes which includes a couple of libm fixes.

### Picolibc version 1.7.2

 1. Fix picolibc.ld to split C++ exceptions back apart (thanks to
    Khalil Estell)

 2. Add vsscanf to tinystdio (required for libstdc++).

 3. Also stick -isystem in C++ compile command to try and get
    picolibc headers to be used instead of newlib.

### Picolibc version 1.7.1

 1. Add __cxa_atexit implementation to 'picoexit' path as required by
    C++

 2. Fix lack of 'hh' support in integer-only tinystdio printf path.

 3. Fix tinystdio __file flag initialization for C++ apps

### Picolibc version 1.7

 1. Merge libc and libm into a single library. Having them split
    doesn't offer any advantages while requiring that applications add
    '-lm' to link successfully. Having them merged allows use of libm
    calls from libc code.

 2. Add hex float format to *printf, *scanf and strto{d,f,ld}. This is
    required for C99 support.

 3. Unify strto{d,f,ld} and *scanf floating point parsing code. This
    ensures that the library is consistent in how floats are parsed.

 4. Make strto{d,f,ld} set errno to ERANGE on overflow/underflow,
    including when the result is a subnormal number.

### Picolibc version 1.6.2

 1. Change `restrict` keyword in published headers to `__restrict` to
    restore compatibility with applications building with --std=c18.

 2. Additional cleanups in time conversion funcs (Thanks to R. Riez)

### Picolibc version 1.6.1

 1. Code cleanups for time conversion funcs (Thanks to R. Diez)

 2. Add '-fno-stack-protector' when supported by the C compiler
    to avoid trouble building with native Ubuntu GCC.

 3. Bug fix for converting denorms with sscanf and strto{d,f,ld}.

 4. Use __asm__ for inline asm code to allow building applications
    with --std=c18

 5. Fix exit code for semihosting 'abort' call to make it visible
    to the hosting system.

 6. Add strfromf and strfromd implementations. These are simple
    wrappers around sscanf, but strfromf handles float conversions
    without requiring a pass through 'double' or special linker hacks.

### Picolibc version 1.6

 1. Bugfix for snprintf(buf, 0) and vsnprintf(buf, 0) to avoid
    smashing memory

 2. Support building libstdc++ on top of picolibc

 3. Add 'hosted' crt0 variant that calls exit when main
    returns. This makes testing easier without burdening embedded apps
    with unused exit processing code.

 4. Add 'minimal' crt0 variant that skips constructors to
    save space on systems known to not use any.

 5. Fix HW floating point initialization on 32-bit ARM processors to
    perform 'dsb' and 'isb' instructions to ensure the FPU enabling
    write is complete before executing any FPU instructions.

 6. Create a new '--picolibc-prefix' GCC command line parameter that
    sets the base of all picolibc file names.

 7. Add bare-metal i386 and x86_64 initializatiton code (thanks to
    Mike Haertel). These initalize the processor from power up to
    running code without requiring any BIOS.

 8. Merge newlib as of late April, 2021

 9. Add 'timegm' function (thanks to R. Diez).

10. Fix a number of tinystdio bugs: handle fread with size==0, parse
    'NAN' and 'INF' in fscanf in a case-insensitive manner, fix
    negative precision to '*' arguments in printf, fix handling of
    'j', 'z' and 't' argument size specifiers (thanks to Sebastian
    Meyer).

11. Make the fenv API more consistent and more conformant with the
    spec. All architectures now fall back to the default code
    for soft float versions, which avoids having the various exception
    and rounding modes get defined when not supported.

### Picolibc version 1.5.1

 1. Make riscv crt0 '_exit' symbol 'weak' to allow linking without
    this function.

### Picolibc version 1.5

 1. Make picolibc more compatible with C++ compilers.
   
 2. Add GCC specs file and linker script for building C++ applications
    with G++ that enable exception handling by linking in call stack
    information.

 3. A few clang build fixes, including libm exception generation

 4. Nano malloc fixes, especially for 'unusual' arguments

 5. Merge in newlib 4.1.0 code

 6. More libm exception/errno/infinity fixes, mostly in the gamma funcs.

 7. Add tests for all semihost v2.0 functions.

 8. A few RISC-V assembly fixes and new libm code.

 9. Build fixes to reliably replace generic code with
    architecture-specific implementations.

With a patch which is pending for GCC 11, we'll be able to build C++
applications that use picolibc with exceptions and iostream.

### Picolibc version 1.4.7

 1. Fix numerous libm exception and errno bugs. The math functions are
    all now verified to match the C19 and Posix standards in this
    area.

 2. Change behavior of 'gamma' function to match glibc which returns
    lgamma for this function. Applications should not use this
    function, they should pick either lgamma or tgamma as appropriate.
 
 3. Fix fma/fmaf on arm and RISC-V so that the machine-specific versions
    are used when the hardware has support. Also fix the math library
    to only use fma/fmaf when it is supported by the hardware.

 4. Fix numerous nano-malloc bugs, especially with unusual parameters.

 5. Change nano-malloc to always clear returned memory.

 6. Improve nano-realloc to perform better in various ways, including
    merging adjacent free blocks and expanding the heap.

 7. Add malloc tests, both a basic functional test and a stress test.

 8. Improve build portability to Windows. Picolibc should now build
    using mingw.

 9. Use hardware TLS register on ARM when available.

 10. Support clang compiler. Thanks to Denis Feklushkin
     <denis.feklushkin@gmail.com> and Joakim NohlgÃ¥rd <joakim@nohlgard.se>.

 11. Avoid implicit float/double conversions. Check this by having
     clang builds use -Wdouble-promotion -Werror=double-promotion
     flags

 12. Have portable code check for machine-specific overrides by
     matching filenames. This avoids building libraries with
     duplicate symbols and retains compatibility with newlib (which
     uses a different mechanism for this effect).

 13. Patches to support building with [CompCert](http://compcert.inria.fr/), a
     formally verified compiler. Thanks to Sebastian Meyer
     <meyer@absint.com>.

### Picolibc version 1.4.6

 1. Install 'ssp' (stack smashing protection) header files. This fixes
    compiling with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

 2. Make getc/ungetc re-entrant. This feature, which is enabled by
    default, uses atomic instruction sequences that do not require
    OS support.

 3. Numerous iconv fixes, including enabling testing and switching
    external CCS file loading to use stdio. By default, iconv provides
    built-in CCS data for all of the supported encodings, which takes
    a fairly large amount of read-only memory. Iconv is now always
    included in picolibc as  it isn't included in applications unless
    explicitly referenced by them.

 4. Add __getauxval stub implementation to make picolibc work with
    GCC version 10 compiled for aarch64-linux-gnu.

 5. Change how integer- and float- only versions of printf and scanf
    are selected. Instead of re-defining the symbols using the C
    preprocessor, picolibc now re-defines the symbols at link
    time. This avoids having applications compiled with a mixture of
    modes link in multiple versions of the underlying functions, while
    still preserving the smallest possible integer-only
    implementation.

 6. Document how to use picolibc on a native POSIX system for
    testing. Check out the [os.md](doc/os.md) file for details.

 7. Merge current newlib bits in. This includes better fenv support,
    for which tests are now included in the picolibc test suite.

### Picolibc version 1.4.5

 1. Fix section order in picolibc.ld to give applications correct
    control over the layout of .preserve, .init and .fini regions.

 2. Add startup and TLS support for aarch64 and non Cortex-M 32-bit
    arm.

### Picolibc version 1.4.4

 1. Fix floating point 'g' format output in tinystdio. (e.g.,
    for 10.0, print '10' instead of '1e+01'). There are tests which
    verify a range of 'g' cases like these now.
    
 2. Merge current newlib bits. The only thing which affects picolibc
    is the addition of fenv support for arm.

### Picolibc version 1.4.3

 1. Make fix for CVE 2019-14871 - CVE 2019-14878 in original newlib
    stdio code not call 'abort'. Allocation failures are now reported
    back to the application.

 2. Add 'exact' floating point print/scan code to tinystdio. Thanks
    to Sreepathi Pai for pointing me at the Ryu code by Ulf
    Adams.

 3. Add regular expression functions from newlib. These were removed
    by accident while removing POSIX filesystem-specific code.

 4. Make tinystdio versions of [efg]cvt functions. This means that the
    default tinystdio version of picolibc no longer calls malloc from
    these functions.    

 5. More clang-compatibility fixes. (Thanks to Denis Feklushkin)

 6. Remove stdatomic.h and tgmath.h. (they should not be provide by picolibc)

### Picolibc version 1.4.2

 1. Clang source compatibility. Clang should now be able to compile
    the library. Thanks to Denis Feklushkin for figuring out how
    to make this work.

 2. aarch64 support. This enables the existing aarch64 code and
    provides an example configuration file for getting it
    built.  Thanks for Anthony Anderson for this feature.

 3. Testing on github on push and pull-request. For now, this is
    limited to building the library due to a bug in qemu.

 4. Get newlib stdio working again. You can now usefully use Newlib's
    stdio. This requires a working malloc and is substantially larger
    than tinystdio, but has more accurate floating point input. This
    requires POSIX functions including read, write and a few others.

 5. Fix long double strtold. The working version is only available
    when using tinystdio; if using newlib stdio, strtold is simply not
    available.

 6. Improve tinystdio support for C99 printf/scanf additions.

 7. Check for correct prefix when sysroot-install option is
    selected. The value of this option depends on how gcc was
    configured, and (alas) meson won't let us set it at runtime, so
    instead we complain if the wrong value was given and display the
    correct value.

 8. Sync up with current newlib head.

### Picolibc version 1.4.1

This release contains an important TLS fix for ARM along with a few
minor compatibility fixes

 1. Make __aeabi_read_tp respect ARM ABI register requirements to
    avoid clobbering register contents during TLS variable use.

 2. Use cpu_family instead of cpu in meson config, which is 'more
    correct' when building for a single cpu instead of multilib.

 3. Make arm sample interrupt vector work with clang

 4. Use __inline instead of inline in published headers to allow
    compiling with -ansi

 5. Make 'naked' RISC-V _start function contain only asm
    statements as required by clang (and recommended by gcc).

 6. Use -msave-restore in sample RISC-V cross-compile
    configuration. This saves text space.

### Picolibc version 1.4

This release was focused on cleaning up the copyright and license
information.

 1. Copyright information should now be present in every source file.

 2. License information, where it could be inferred from the
    repository, was added to many files.

 3. 4-clause BSD licenses were changed (with permission) to 3-clause

 4. Fix RISC-V ieeefp.h exception bits

 5. Merge past newlib 3.2.0

 6. Add PICOLIBC_TLS preprocessor define when the library has TLS support

### Picolibc version 1.3

This release now includes tests, and fixes bugs found by them.

 1. ESP8266 support added, thanks to Jonathan McDowell.

 2. Numerous test cases from newlib have been fixed, and
    precision requirements adjusted so that the library now
    passes its own test suite on x86, RISC-V and ARM.

 3. String/number conversion bug fixes. This includes fcvt/ecvt/gcvt
    shared with newlib and tinystdio printf/scanf

 4. A few RISC-V ABI fixes, including setting the TLS base correctly,
    compiling with -mcmodel=medany, and enabling the FPU for libraries
    built to use it.

 5. Semihosting updates, including adding unlink, kill and getpid
    (which are used by some tests).

### Picolibc version 1.2

This release includes important fixes in picolibc.ld and more
semihosting support.

 1. File I/O and clock support for semihosting. This enables fopen/fdopen
    support in tinystdio along with an API to fetch a real time clock
    value.

 2. Fix picolibc.ld to not attempt to use redefined symbols for memory
    space definitions. These re-definitions would fail and the default
    values be used for system memory definitions. Instead, just use
    the ? : operators each place the values are needed. Linker scripts
    continue to mystify.

 3. Expose library definitions in 'picolibc.h', instead of 'newlib.h'
    and '_newlib_version.h'

 4. Define HAVE_SEMIHOST when semihosting support is available. This
    lets the 'hello-world' example do some semihost specific things.

### Picolibc version 1.1

A minor update from 1.0, this release includes:

 1. semihost support. This adds console I/O and exit(3) support on ARM
    and RISC-V hosts using the standard semihosting interfaces.

 2. Posix I/O support in tinystdio. When -Dposix-io=true is included
    in the meson command line (which is the default), tinystdio adds
    support for fopen and fdopen by using malloc, open, close, read,
    write and lseek. If -Dposix-console=true is also passed to meson,
    then picolibc will direct stdin/stdout/stderr to the posix
    standard file descriptors (0, 1, 2).

 3. Merge recent upstream newlib code. This brings picolibc up to date
    with current newlib sources.

 4. Hello world example. This uses a simple Makefile to demonstrate
    how to us picolibc when installed for ARM and RISC-V embedded
    processors. The resulting executables can be run under qemu.

 5. Remove newlib/libm/mathfp directory. This experimental code never
    worked correctly anyways.

### Picolibc version 1.0

This is the first release of picolibc. Major changes from newlib
include:

 1. Remove all non-BSD licensed code. None of it was used in building
    the embedded library, and removing it greatly simplifies the
    license situation.

 2. Move thread-local values to native TLS mechanism

 3. Add smaller stdio from avr-libc, which is enabled by default

 4. Switch build system to meson. This has two notable benefits; the first
    is that building the library is much faster, the second is that
    it isolates build system changes from newlib making merging of
    newlib changes much easier.

 5. Add simple startup code. This can be used in environments that
    don't have complicated requirements, allowing small applications
    to avoid needing to figure this out.
